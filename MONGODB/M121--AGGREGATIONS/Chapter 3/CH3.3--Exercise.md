# Ejercicio
In the last lab, we calculated a normalized rating that required us to know what the minimum and maximum values for imdb.votes were. These values were found using the $group stage!

For all films that won at least 1 Oscar, calculate the standard deviation, highest, lowest, and average imdb.rating. Use the sample standard deviation expression.

HINT - All movies in the collection that won an Oscar begin with a string resembling one of the following in their awards field


```
Won 13 Oscars
Won 1 Oscar
```

```bash
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      awards: /Won \d{1,2} Oscars?/
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      highest_rating: { $max: "$imdb.rating" },
      lowest_rating: { $min: "$imdb.rating" },
      average_rating: { $avg: "$imdb.rating" },
      deviation: { $stdDevSamp: "$imdb.rating" }
    }
  }
])
```
> `/Won \d{1,2} Oscars?/``
> - \d corresponde a dígito
> - {1,2} corresponde a número de 1 y/o 2 dígitos
> - ? indica que la "s" puede estar o no
